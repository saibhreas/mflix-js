Running the Unit Tests
To run the unit tests for this course, you will use Jest. Jest has been included in this project's dependencies, so npm install should install everything you need.

Each course lab contains a module of unit tests that you can call individually with npm test from mflix-js directory like the following:

npm test -t TICKET_TEST_NAME

Each ticket will contain the exact command to run that ticket's specific unit tests. You can run these commands from anywhere in the mflix-js project. Bear in mind that a tests will fail until the corresponding ticket is completed. For example to run the Connection Ticket test your shell command will be:

npm test -t db-connection

npm test -t projection
